## Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

## Basic Markdown Syntax

### Headers

```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

### Emphasis

```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
```

### Lists

#### Unordered

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

#### Ordered

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b
```

## Extended Markdown in Hugo

Hugo uses a Markdown processor called Goldmark that supports standard Markdown and various extensions. Some of the extended features include:

- Tables
- Footnotes
- Definition lists
- Task lists
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Auto linking of URLs

## Conclusion

Mastering Markdown makes content creation in Hugo simple and efficient. The plaintext nature of Markdown means your content remains portable and easy to version control.
